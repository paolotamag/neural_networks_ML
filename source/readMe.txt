question 1.1
---
run single optimization choosing c and N yourself:
python 1-1_single_optim_1536242.py

plot the 3d scatter plot and the approx of my solution:
python 1-1_plot_1536242.py

run yourself the iterations to look for the best N and c 
combination within a certain range:
python 1-1_N-c_1536242.py
--------------------

question 1.2
---
run single optimization choosing c and N yourself:
python 1-2_single_optim_1536242.py

plot the 3d scatter plot and the approx of my solution:
python 1-2_plot_1536242.py

run yourself the iterations to look for the best N and 
sigma combination within a certain range:
python 1-2_N-sig_1536242.py
--------------------

--------------------
question 2.1
---
run single optimization choosing c and N yourself:
python 2-1_single_optim_1536242.py

plot the 3d scatter plot and the approx of my solution:
python 2-1_plot_1536242.py

run yourself the iterations to look for the best N and 
sigma combination within a certain range:
python 2-1_N-sig_1536242.py
